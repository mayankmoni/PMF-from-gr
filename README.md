This is fortran code which can be used to estimate the potentials of mean force from radial distribtuion functions. 
The input file to this code will the raw data of RDFs. 
The following equation is used to compute PMF from RDF.
PMF(r)=-RTlog(RDF), where R is the molar gas constant. T is temperature of the system.
